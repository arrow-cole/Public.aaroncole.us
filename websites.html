**Styling:**

You can use CSS to style your webpage and make it more visually appealing. There are many resources available online to learn about HTML and CSS.

Here are some additional tips:

* You can categorize your websites by topic by creating separate unordered lists with headings for each category.
* You can add short descriptions to each link to give users a better idea of what the website is about.
